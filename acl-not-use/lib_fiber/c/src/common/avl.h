/*
 * This is a generic implemenatation of AVL trees for use in the Solaris kernel.
 * The interfaces provide an efficient way of implementing an ordered set of
 * data structures.
 *
 * AVL trees provide an alternative to using an ordered linked list. Using AVL
 * trees will usually be faster, however they requires more storage. An ordered
 * linked list in general requires 2 pointers in each data structure. The
 * AVL tree implementation uses 3 pointers. The following chart gives the
 * approximate performance of operations with the different approaches:
 *
 *	Operation	 Link List	AVL tree
 *	---------	 --------	--------
 *	lookup		   O(n)		O(log(n))
 *
 *	insert 1 node	 constant	constant
 *
 *	delete 1 node	 constant	between constant and O(log(n))
 *
 *	delete all nodes   O(n)		O(n)
 *
 *	visit the next
 *	or prev node	 constant	between constant and O(log(n))
 *
 *
 * The data structure nodes are anchored at an "fiber_avl_tree_t" (the equivalent
 * of a list header) and the individual nodes will have a field of
 * type "fiber_avl_node_t" (corresponding to list pointers).
 *
 * The type "fiber_avl_index_t" is used to indicate a position in the list for
 * certain calls.
 *
 * The usage scenario is generally:
 *
 * 1. Create the list/tree with: fiber_avl_create()
 *
 * followed by any mixture of:
 *
 * 2a. Insert nodes with: fiber_avl_add(), or fiber_avl_find() and fiber_avl_insert()
 *
 * 2b. Visited elements with:
 *	 fiber_avl_first() - returns the lowest valued node
 *	 fiber_avl_last() - returns the highest valued node
 *	 AVL_NEXT() - given a node go to next higher one
 *	 AVL_PREV() - given a node go to previous lower one
 *
 * 2c.  Find the node with the closest value either less than or greater
 *	than a given value with fiber_avl_nearest().
 *
 * 2d. Remove individual nodes from the list/tree with fiber_avl_remove().
 *
 * and finally when the list is being destroyed
 *
 * 3. Use fiber_avl_destroy_nodes() to quickly process/free up any remaining nodes.
 *    Note that once you use fiber_avl_destroy_nodes(), you can no longer
 *    use any routine except fiber_avl_destroy_nodes() and avl_destoy().
 *
 * 4. Use fiber_avl_destroy() to destroy the AVL tree itself.
 *
 * Any locking for multiple thread access is up to the user to provide, just
 * as is needed for any linked list implementation.
